# E-KOR Rusted

This Project is just me playing with the Blockchain technology and Cryptography. Hopefully I will release a working version someday.

## Main Points

 - Proof-of-Work - I say that PoW is the only way how you can trust cryptocurrencies in general. It's the proof of the technology being backed up by the power it consumes during verification.
 - Rust - Rust being pretty new and low level makes it a great candidate for this Project. Supporting many features and being blazingly fast, sounds good to me.
 - Sha3 and Keccak - Once I was on a convention about quantum computers and hearing the power it has made me paranoid about Sha2, so I chose to use Keccak and Sha3 for the Project.
